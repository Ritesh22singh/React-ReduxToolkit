// This code is the entry point for a React application that is set up to use Redux for state management. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

// Purpose of the Code
// This code renders the main <App /> component to the root of the webpage and wraps it in a Redux provider to make the Redux store available throughout the app.

// Summary
// This code renders the main React app component (App) inside the HTML element with the ID root. By wrapping <App /> with <Provider store={store}>, it makes the Redux store available across the entire app, allowing any component within <App /> to access the Redux state and dispatch actions.
